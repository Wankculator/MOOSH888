# ✅ WALLET IMPORT FIX COMPLETE

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
When importing a Unisat wallet seed, only one address was available and all other address types showed "Not available".

### Root Cause
The `simple-api.js` server was missing the `/api/spark/import` endpoint entirely. It only had a balance checking endpoint, so wallet imports were failing with 404 errors.

### Solution Implemented
Added the complete import endpoint to `simple-api.js`:

1. **Import Functionality**: Added `importSparkCompatibleWallet` import
2. **POST Endpoint**: Created `/api/spark/import` handler
3. **Full Address Derivation**: All Bitcoin address types are now properly generated:
   - Native SegWit (bc1q...)
   - Taproot (bc1p...)
   - Legacy (1...)
   - Nested SegWit (3...)
   - Spark Protocol addresses

## How to Use

1. **Restart the API Server**:
   ```bash
   # Stop any existing server
   pkill -f "simple-api.js"
   
   # Start the updated server
   cd "/mnt/c/Users/sk84l/OneDrive/Desktop/MOOSH WALLET"
   node src/server/simple-api.js
   ```

2. **Import Your Wallet**:
   - Open your wallet in the browser
   - Go to import wallet
   - Enter your Unisat seed phrase
   - Click import

3. **All Addresses Will Be Available**:
   - You'll see all address types properly derived
   - Private keys will be available for all addresses
   - You can switch between different address types in the dashboard

## Technical Details

The import endpoint now:
- Validates the mnemonic phrase
- Derives addresses using proper BIP standards (BIP44, BIP49, BIP84, BIP86)
- Returns complete wallet data including:
  - All Bitcoin address types
  - Private keys in both HEX and WIF formats
  - Spark protocol addresses
  - Proper data structure expected by the frontend

## Verification

The import function was tested and confirmed working:
- ✅ SegWit addresses generated
- ✅ Taproot addresses generated
- ✅ Legacy addresses generated
- ✅ Nested SegWit addresses generated
- ✅ All private keys available
- ✅ Spark addresses generated

Your wallet is now fully functional with all address types properly derived from your seed phrase!
