Instead of cluttering your professional folder, create a separate reference archive:

```

├── MOOSH WALLET/              # ✅ CLEAN PROFESSIONAL
│   ├── server.js
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── package.json
│   └── START_HERE.md
│
└── MOOSH-REFERENCE-ARCHIVE/   # 📚 SEPARATE REFERENCE
    ├── version1.html          # Original builds
    ├── version2.html          # Previous iterations
    ├── version3.html          # Feature experiments
    ├── moosh-wallet-live.html # Live versions
    └── index-clean.html       # Clean versions
```
