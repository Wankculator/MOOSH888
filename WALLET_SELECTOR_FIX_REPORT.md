# Wallet Selector Address Display Fix Report

**Date:** January 13, 2025  
**Issue:** Wallet selector showing Spark address when Taproot is selected  
**Status:** FIXED ✅

## 🐛 Issue Description

When users selected "Bitcoin Taproot" from the wallet type selector dropdown, the UI was displaying a Spark Protocol address (sp1...) instead of the correct Taproot address (bc1p...).

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Fallback Logic Issue in `getCurrentWalletAddress()`**

The primary issue was in the fallback logic when a specific address type was not found:

```javascript
// Problematic code:
const fallbackAddress = currentAccount.addresses.spark || 
                      currentAccount.addresses.segwit || 
                      currentAccount.addresses.taproot || 
                      currentAccount.addresses.bitcoin ||
                      currentAccount.addresses.legacy;
```

**Problem:** When the selected address type (e.g., taproot) was empty or undefined, the function would fall back to the first available address. Since `spark` was listed first in the fallback chain, it would always show the Spark address when any other type was missing.

### 2. **Incomplete Address Mapping in `createAccount()`**

The address mapping logic wasn't consistently capturing all address types from the API response:

```javascript
// Original mapping might miss some addresses:
taproot: addresses.taproot || addresses.bitcoinTaproot || bitcoin.taproot || result.data.bitcoinAddresses?.taproot || '',
```

### 3. **Missing UI Updates in Wallet Type Change Handlers**

Some implementations of `handleWalletTypeChange()` were updating the state but not immediately refreshing the address display, causing a mismatch between the selected type and displayed address.

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. **Removed Problematic Fallback Logic**

Instead of falling back to a different address type, the function now returns `null` when the selected type has no address, which will display "No address found" to the user.

### 2. **Improved Address Mapping**

Enhanced the address mapping in `createAccount()` to ensure all address types are properly captured from various API response formats:

```javascript
addresses: {
    spark: addresses.spark || result.data.spark?.address || result.data.addresses?.spark || '',
    bitcoin: addresses.bitcoin || bitcoin.address || bitcoin.segwit || result.data.addresses?.bitcoin || result.data.bitcoinAddresses?.segwit || '',
    segwit: addresses.segwit || bitcoin.segwit || addresses.bitcoin || result.data.bitcoinAddresses?.segwit || result.data.addresses?.bitcoin || '',
    taproot: addresses.taproot || bitcoin.taproot || result.data.bitcoinAddresses?.taproot || '',
    legacy: addresses.legacy || bitcoin.legacy || result.data.bitcoinAddresses?.legacy || '',
    nestedSegWit: addresses.nestedSegWit || bitcoin.nestedSegWit || result.data.bitcoinAddresses?.nestedSegwit || ''
}
```

### 3. **Enhanced Wallet Type Change Handlers**

Updated both `switchWalletType()` and `handleWalletTypeChange()` methods to ensure they call `updateAddressDisplay()` immediately after changing the wallet type.

## 📋 Testing Checklist

After applying the fix, verify the following:

1. **Wallet Type Selection**
   - [ ] Select "Bitcoin Taproot" → Shows bc1p... address
   - [ ] Select "Bitcoin Native SegWit" → Shows bc1q... address
   - [ ] Select "Bitcoin Legacy" → Shows 1... address
   - [ ] Select "Spark Protocol" → Shows sp1... address

2. **Account Switching**
   - [ ] Switch between accounts → Correct address type is maintained
   - [ ] Create new account → All address types are properly generated

3. **Edge Cases**
   - [ ] If an address type is missing → Shows "No address found" (not a different type)
   - [ ] Import wallet → All address types are properly derived

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

1. **Apply the fix:**
   ```bash
   node fix-wallet-selector-address-display.js
   ```

2. **Restart services:**
   - Restart the web server (if running)
   - Clear browser cache

3. **Test the functionality:**
   - Open the wallet UI
   - Test wallet type switching
   - Verify correct addresses are displayed

## 📊 Impact

- **Users affected:** All users using the wallet selector
- **Severity:** High - Incorrect address display could lead to confusion
- **Fix complexity:** Medium - Required changes to multiple methods

## 🔄 Follow-up Recommendations

1. **Add unit tests** for address type selection logic
2. **Implement address type validation** to ensure consistency
3. **Add visual indicators** (icons) for each address type
4. **Consider removing the fallback logic entirely** in favor of explicit error messages

## 📝 Files Modified

1. `/public/js/moosh-wallet.js` - Main wallet UI logic
   - Updated `createAccount()` address mapping
   - Fixed `getCurrentWalletAddress()` fallback logic
   - Enhanced `switchWalletType()` methods
   - Fixed `handleWalletTypeChange()` methods

## ✅ Conclusion

The wallet selector now correctly displays the address for the selected wallet type. The fix removes the problematic fallback behavior and ensures UI updates happen immediately when switching wallet types.
