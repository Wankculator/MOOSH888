## 🚀 Next Phase: Enhanced Features

3. **Account Avatars** - Visual identifiers for accounts
4. **Balance Integration** - Show real-time balances in grid
5. **Activity Timestamps** - Last transaction indicators

### Technical Debt
- Implement proper balance sorting (currently placeholder)
- Add loading states for async operations
- Consider pagination for users with many accounts

2. Or select "Manage Accounts" from the AccountSwitcher dropdown
3. Use the search bar to find specific accounts
4. Click the edit button (✏️) to rename accounts
