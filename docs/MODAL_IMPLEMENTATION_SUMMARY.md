## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Pure JavaScript DOM Manipulation
```javascript
// Example of modal creation pattern
showSendModal() {
    const $ = ElementFactory;
    const overlay = $.div({ 
        className: 'modal-overlay',
        onclick: (e) => {
            if (e.target.className === 'modal-overlay') {
                this.closeModal();
            }
        }
    }, [/* modal content */]);
    
    document.body.appendChild(overlay);
    this.addModalStyles();
}
```

### Key Methods Added
- `showSendModal()` - Displays the send transaction modal
- `showReceiveModal()` - Displays the receive/share address modal
- `createFeeOption()` - Helper for fee selection radio buttons
- `closeModal()` - Removes modal from DOM
- `processSend()` - Handles send form submission
- `copyAddress()` - Copies address to clipboard
- `addModalStyles()` - Injects modal CSS dynamically

## ðŸ“‹ Integration Points

### Dashboard Quick Actions
- Send button now calls `showSendModal()`
- Receive button now calls `showReceiveModal()`
- Swap and Settings still show "coming soon" notifications

### Future API Integration
The modals are ready for API integration:
- Send modal can connect to Bitcoin transaction APIs
