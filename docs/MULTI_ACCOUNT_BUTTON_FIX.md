# Multi-Account Modal Button Fix

**Date**: July 12, 2025  
**Branch**: `wallet-ui-improvements`

## 🎯 Summary

Fixed the multi-account modal to properly show Create and Import forms when buttons are clicked, and ensured the multi-account system initializes when users first generate a wallet.

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. "Create New Account" Button Not Working ✅

**Problem**: Clicking "Create New Account" did nothing visible  
**Root Cause**: Two issues combined:
1. The MultiAccountModal had mixed implementations
2. The second part was missing form methods
3. Buttons were calling methods that directly created accounts without showing forms

**Solution**: 
- Added "Import Account" button to the modal
- Updated button handlers to set flags and re-render the modal
- Added createNewAccountForm() and createImportForm() methods
- Connected form submission to account creation logic

### 2. Missing "Import Account" Button ✅

**Problem**: User could only create new accounts, not import existing ones  
**Solution**: Added Import Account button with full form and validation

### 3. Multi-Account System Not Initialized ✅

**Problem**: First wallet generation didn't create an account in the multi-account system  
**Solution**: Modified "Open Wallet Dashboard" button to initialize the first account automatically

## 📋 Files Modified
