# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL DASHBOARD FIX

## Problem Identified
**Error**: `Uncaught TypeError: $.select is not a function`
**Location**: `moosh-wallet.js:6599` in `createWalletTypeSelector`
**Impact**: Dashboard fails to render - shows black screen after wallet creation

## Root Cause
The ElementFactory class was missing a `select` method, which was being called in multiple dashboard components to create dropdown menus.

## Fix Applied
Added the missing `select` method to ElementFactory class:

```javascript
static select(attrs = {}, children = []) {
    return this.create('select', attrs, children);
}
```

## Files Modified
- `/public/js/moosh-wallet.js` - Added select method at line 125

## Components Affected
All components that use `$.select()`:
1. `createWalletTypeSelector()` - Wallet type dropdown
2. `SwapModal` - Token selection dropdowns
3. `WalletSettingsModal` - Various setting dropdowns
4. `MultiAccountModal` - Account selection

## Testing Required
1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3333
3. Create a new wallet
4. Click "Open Dashboard"
5. **Expected**: Dashboard loads successfully with all components

## Additional Browser Console Errors
The console shows some unrelated errors from browser extensions:
- Pocket Universe extension errors
- Magic Eden wallet errors
- These do NOT affect MOOSH Wallet functionality

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - The critical `$.select is not a function` error has been resolved.

The dashboard should now render properly when clicking "Open Dashboard" after wallet creation.
