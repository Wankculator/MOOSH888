# Dashboard Access Fix

**Date**: July 12, 2025  
**Branch**: `wallet-ui-improvements`

## 🎯 Summary

Fixed the error preventing access to the dashboard after wallet generation. The issue was that multi-account methods (`getAccounts`, `getCurrentAccount`, etc.) were missing from the `StateManager` class.

## 🐛 Issue Fixed

### Error: "this.app.state.getAccounts is not a function"

**Problem**: When clicking "Open Wallet Dashboard" after generating a wallet, the app crashed with:
```
Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: this.app.state.getAccounts is not a function
    at WalletDetailsPage.openWalletDashboard (moosh-wallet.js:11069:45)
```

**Root Cause**: The `StateManager` class was missing several multi-account methods that were being called throughout the application.

**Solution**: Added all missing multi-account methods to the `StateManager` class:
- `getAccounts()` - Returns all accounts
- `getCurrentAccount()` - Returns the currently active account
- `getAccountById(id)` - Returns a specific account by ID
- `createAccount(name, mnemonic, isImport)` - Creates a new account
- `switchAccount(accountId)` - Switches to a different account
- `renameAccount(accountId, newName)` - Renames an account
- `deleteAccount(accountId)` - Deletes an account

## 📋 Files Modified

1. `/public/js/moosh-wallet.js`
   - Added missing multi-account methods to StateManager class (lines 2078-2179)
   - All methods properly integrated with existing state management
   - Proper error handling and persistence

## 🧪 Testing

### To Test the Fix:
1. Generate a new wallet (12 or 24 words)
2. Complete seed confirmation
3. Click "Open Wallet Dashboard"
4. Dashboard should load without errors
5. Multi-account functionality should work:
   - Add new accounts
   - Import accounts
   - Switch between accounts
   - Rename accounts
   - Delete accounts

### Test Helper:
Use `/test-dashboard-access.html` to:
- Create test accounts
- Check current state
- Clear all data for fresh testing
- Direct dashboard access testing

## ✅ Verification

The fix has been verified by:
1. JavaScript syntax validation passed
2. All multi-account methods properly defined
3. Proper integration with existing code
4. Account persistence working correctly

## 🔑 Key Changes

```javascript
// Added to StateManager class:
getAccounts() {
    return this.state.accounts || [];
}

getCurrentAccount() {
    const accounts = this.getAccounts();
    return accounts.find(acc => acc.id === this.state.currentAccountId) || accounts[0] || null;
}

// Plus other multi-account methods...
```
