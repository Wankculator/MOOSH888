# SYNTAX ERROR FIXED âœ…

## Issue Found:
- **Error:** `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '}'` at line 13086
- **Cause:** Extra code fragments were left after the main closure `})(window);`
- **Impact:** JavaScript file wouldn't load, breaking entire application

## Fix Applied:
- Removed all code after line 13085 (the proper closing)
- File now ends correctly with `})(window);`
- No functionality lost - the removed code was duplicate/leftover fragments

## To Test:
1. **Stop the current server** (Ctrl+C)
2. **Restart the server:**
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\sk84l\OneDrive\Desktop\MOOSH WALLET"
   node src/server/server.js
   ```
3. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. **Navigate to:** http://localhost:3334

## Expected Result:
- No more syntax errors in console
- All buttons should work
- Modals should open correctly

## Other Console Messages (Can Ignore):
- Pocket Universe messages - from browser extension
- Magic Eden messages - from browser extension
- These don't affect MOOSH Wallet functionality

The wallet should now load and function properly!
