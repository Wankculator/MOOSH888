# ✅ Error Fixed: Dashboard Now Working!

## 🐛 Issue Found
The error was: `Uncaught TypeError: $.h3 is not a function`

This occurred when trying to create the transaction history section header.

## 🔧 Solution Applied
Added the missing `h2` and `h3` methods to the ElementFactory class:

```javascript
static h2(attrs = {}, children = []) {
    return this.create('h2', attrs, children);
}

static h3(attrs = {}, children = []) {
    return this.create('h3', attrs, children);
}
```

## ✅ Result
The dashboard is now fully functional! You can:

1. **Access it directly**: http://localhost:3333#dashboard
