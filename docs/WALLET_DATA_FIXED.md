# MOOSH Wallet Data Issue - FIXED ✅

## Problem
The wallet generation was failing because the wrong API server was running. The `wallet-api-server.js` was running instead of `simple-api-server.js`.

## Solution
1. Stopped the incorrect API server
2. Started the correct `simple-api-server.js` which uses the EXACT Spark implementation
3. Updated `start-all.js` to use the correct API server

## Current Status
- ✅ UI Server: Running on http://localhost:3333
- ✅ API Server: Running on http://localhost:3001 (simple-api-server.js)
- ✅ Implementation: Using EXACT Spark implementation with test vectors
- ✅ Data Format: Correctly returning all required fields

## API Response Format (Now Working)
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {
        "mnemonic": "saddle dry aware dial clay orient group gown shiver title garage glide",
        "addresses": {
